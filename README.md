## Description

Motivation behind this project was to better understand generating div elements versus hard coding it into the html, and to better understand localstorage items. I also learned the correct way of calling methods with parameters, and how to call an html element via class and id. This planner can be used to enter in tasks for the day and help visual in what order they should be done in.
